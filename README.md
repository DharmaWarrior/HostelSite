## About
I have created this Hostel Application Form using React and JavaScript .

The steps to run:
1. `git clone https://github.com/DharmaWarrior/Hostel-Site` - git clone the repo and `cd` in the folder
2. `npm install` - this will build the custom src file as a package 
3. `npm run dev` - it will run the project on local host. 

*All the source code is hosted on the main repo.*
